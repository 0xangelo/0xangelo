### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Move-based fully on-chain perpetuals exchange
- ⏱️ I've previously worked as both a Move and Rust engineer at Aftermath Finance as [unmaykr-aftermath](https://github.com/unmaykr-aftermath)
  - See the [Rust SDK](https://github.com/AftermathFinance/aftermath-sdk-rust) previously created and maintained by me
